  _A development collective writing systems as carefully as it writes stories._ \
  私たちは、感情を構造に変える。We turn emotion into structure.
  
  ## Who We Are 私たちは誰ですか
  
  _"We are not a studio. We are a structure for stories."_
  
  **Tokari Works** is an interdisciplinary team based, focused on the development of visual novels and the tools that power them.
  
  We operate at the intersection of **software engineering**, **narrative systems**, and **aesthetic design**, crafting visual experiences that balance **technical depth** with **emotional intent**.

## Development Philosophy 開発思想

- Emotions are treated as **architectures**
- Choices are designed as **intersections**
- Systems are constructed to be **narratively reactive**

Our methodology integrates literary sensitivity with engineering discipline.

## The Collective チームについて

Tokari Works is not defined by production, but by **construction**.  
From narrative engineers to visual technologists, we build expressive frameworks that give shape to emotion, intention, and choice.  
Our collective combines **computational fluency** with **editorial precision** to enable literary systems that endure.
