## Who We Are

**Tokari Works** is an interdisciplinary team based, focused on the development of visual novels and the tools that power them.

We operate at the intersection of **software engineering**, **narrative systems**, and **aesthetic design**, crafting visual experiences that balance **technical depth** with **emotional intent**.

> _「物語は、ただ読むものではない。それは感じる構造だ。」_  
> “A story is not just read — it’s a structure you feel.”

## Technical Scope

- 📘 **Narrative Systems**  
  Design of branching logic, emotional pacing, stateful dialogue and narrative flow.

- 🎨 **Art & Presentation**  
  Frameworks for expressive UI/UX, animation, and cinematic visual composition.

- 📂 **Pipeline & Tools**  
  Asset automation, versioning, and team-oriented tooling for VN production.

## Development Philosophy

We don’t just tell stories. We design how stories move.

- Emotions are **architected**
- Choices are **layered**
- Systems are **narrative-aware**
